    <article class="content">
        <div>

            <p>Vivid Mountain trading division of The Mountain Experience Company Limited. If you’re booking a skiing
                holiday with us, your contract is with The Mountain Experience Company Limited (Company Number 9537139).
                Please read these conditions carefully as they set out what you are legally entitled to expect from us
                when you buy our holiday services. “You” and “your” means all persons named in the booking.</p>

            <h3>OUR COMMITMENT TO YOU</h3>
            <h4>Responsibility for your holiday</h4>

            <p>We are responsible for ensuring that each part of the holiday you book with us is provided to a proper
                standard and as was advertised by us, or changed and accepted by you. We have taken all reasonable care
                to make sure that all the services which make up your holiday are provided by efficient and reputable
                businesses.</p>

            <p>We accept liability for matters which arise as a direct result of our negligence or breach of duty to
                exercise care in making arrangements for you including any acts or omissions by our employees or agents
                while they are operating within the scope of their normal duties. Furthermore, we will accept liability
                for any negligent act or omission of our suppliers, who operate elements of your holiday arrangements,
                including any claim involving death, personal injury or illness. In respect of carriage by air or road
                and the provision of accommodation, our liability in all cases will be limited in accordance with the
                relevant international conventions or the conditions of the supplier.</p>

            <p>Due care has been taken to ensure that the descriptions, facts and opinions on our website are accurate
                at the time of publishing. Any of the following may change: laws, advertised services, facilities,
                schedules, room layout and furnishings shown in photographs. Errors may occasionally occur. It is
                therefore important that you check all the details of your holiday at the time of booking.</p>
            <h4>Price</h4>

            <p>The prices published on our website are based on the exchange rates and fuel prices at the time of
                publishing. Whilst we make every effort to ensure that prices are accurate at the time of publishing, we
                cannot guarantee these prices.</p>

            <p>Our prices are subject to surcharges on the following: currency fluctuations and Government Actions (for
                example, changes in the rates of Value Added Tax). Only if the amount of any increase in our costs
                exceeds 2% of the total cost of your holiday will we levy a surcharge. The price of your holiday may
                increase after you have booked but no later than 30 days before the departure date stipulated and we
                will forward you an amended invoice reflecting any changes made. If the increase means paying more than
                10% extra on your holiday price you will be entitled to cancel with a full refund of all money paid to
                us. Should you decide to cancel because of this you must do so within 14 days of receiving the invoice
                for the balance of your holiday. This invoice is normally issued 11 weeks before departure. Once you
                have paid for your holiday in full together with surcharges (if any) we guarantee that no further
                surcharges will be made.</p>

            <p>Should you instruct your credit/debit card company to “charge back” any payment(s) properly due from you
                in respect of your booking, we will charge you and administrative fee of £10 per incident and associated
                costs. We further reserve the right to cancel your booking and/or take legal action against you for all
                outstanding payments.</p>
            <h4>Flights</h4>

            <p>You must book your own flight and ensure that your flight is scheduled to land at Geneva Airport and
                before the time specified by us at the time of booking, in order to ensure that your arrival coincides
                with the transfer departure times to resort. We will confirm the airport and transfer depart time on our
                Confirmation Invoice and this will then form part of the contract with you. Once you have booked your
                flight, you must send us the flight details and these must be sent at the latest when you pay the
                balance of your holiday.</p>
            <h4>Alterations</h4>

            <p>We hope and expect to be able to provide you with the holiday we have confirmed to you at the time of
                booking. However, because we make arrangements many months in advance and use the services of
                independent suppliers (such as airlines, hotels etc.) over whom we have no direct control, we
                occasionally do need to make changes. We reserve the right to do so at any time and will let you know as
                soon as we can. Most such changes are minor but occasionally we may have to make a significant
                change.</p>
            <h4>Major changes</h4>

            <p>A major change is one that we make to your holiday arrangements before departure that involves a change
                of resort or a change of accommodation to that of a lower standard. If a major change becomes necessary
                we will inform you as soon as we can before you depart. If we advise you of a major change before your
                departure, then unless it relates to circumstances amounting to force majeure (see below) you have 3
                options:</p>
            <ol class="ol">
                <li>Accept the alternative holiday offered “at additional cost if applicable”</li>
                <li>Purchase another available holiday from us at the prices that apply at that time. If it is cheaper
                    than the original holiday purchased, we will refund the price difference and if it is more expensive
                    you will be charged for the difference.
                </li>
                <li>Cancel your holiday with full refund of all monies paid.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>Compensation</h4>

            <p>In all of these cases including cancellation below, compensation of £25 per person will be paid if the
                major change is notified to you less than 21 days before your scheduled departure.</p>
            <h4>Cancellation by us</h4>

            <p>We aim to provide the holiday as booked. But if, for example, not enough people booked on your holiday or
                if suppliers over whom we have no direct control make significant changes, we may have to cancel the
                holiday.</p>

            <p>If we cancel your holiday, except where this is because you have not paid, we will offer you the 3
                options mentioned above. We will not cancel your holiday within 6 weeks of departure unless for reasons
                beyond our control (see ‘Important Note: Events beyond our control below’).</p>
            <h4>Important Note: events beyond our control</h4>

            <p>We will not pay any compensation for changes caused by reason of war or threat of war, riots, civil
                strife, terrorist activity, industrial disputes, natural or nuclear disasters, fire, technical problems
                of transport, closure or congestion of airports, adverse weather conditions, epidemics, health risks,
                changes due to rescheduling or cancellation of flights by an airline or alteration of the airline or
                aircraft type for reasons beyond our control or that of our suppliers, or events or circumstances beyond
                our control amounting to force majeure and Acts of God.</p>

            <p>In February 2005 a new Europe-wide law relating to denied boarding, delays and cancellation of flights
                came into force. This law granted rights to passengers including in certain circumstances the right to
                cancel their flight and receive reimbursement of the cost of the flight from their airline. Full details
                of these rights is publicised at EU airports and is also available from affected airlines. However, you
                should note that reimbursement of the cost of a flight that forms part of your holiday is the
                responsibility of your holiday airline and will not automatically entitle you to reimbursement of the
                cost of your holiday from us.</p>
            <h4>Consumer protection</h4>

            <p>The Mountain Experience Company Limited is a Travel Trust Association (TTA) Member (membership number
                Q3634). Every TTA member deposits the money paid for a holiday into the Trust Account which is a bank
                account designated to hold the customer's money. Your money remains in the Trust Account and is
                supervised by an appointed trustee who is either a banker, chartered or certified accountant or a
                solicitor. In addition to your money being held in trust, the TTA will guarantee the financial
                obligation of its members up to a maximum any one passenger of £11,000. So if you paid £2,000 the TTA
                guarantees it will reimburse the loss of the £2,000, where it is not available for you from the Trust
                Account. Therefore, the Trust Account plus the guarantee will ensure that all the money which you have
                paid is safely protected and available to reimburse the money paid. When you make a booking, you will be
                supplied with a guarantee certificate – you can see the terms of our guarantee on
                www.traveltrust.co.uk/guarantee. Should the TTA member become insolvent, in most instances your money
                will still be held within the TTA member’s Trust Account by the designated Trustee, and available to pay
                for your holiday. If because of fraud or dishonesty the money is not there, then the guarantee is
                available to reimburse your loss. In some cases your holiday may continue as the providers or suppliers
                have already been paid. Where you have only paid a deposit and still have an outstanding balance, your
                holiday may be unaffected and by paying the balance your holiday will continue as planned. Where
                possible, attempts will be made to ensure that you can carry on with your original holiday
                arrangements.</p>
            <h4>Snow and weather conditions</h4>

            <p>We cannot accept responsibility for the snow or weather conditions experienced during your holiday or the
                effect these may have on your travel arrangements, accommodation, skiing or ski instruction. Whilst we
                do not offer a snow guarantee we have specially chosen resorts which should provide good snow
                conditions.</p>
            <h4>Refunds</h4>

            <p>We will not make any refund to you for unused portions of air, bus or other tickets, unused accommodation
                or meals, unused ski hire, ski lift passes or ski instruction. No representative or agent of The
                Mountain Experience Company Limited is authorised to promise or make any refund to you.</p>
            <h4>Personal injury</h4>

            <p>If you suffer injury, illness or death directly as a result of the services provided as part of your
                holiday, we may make a payment to you. We will not make a payment if your injury, illness or death was
                caused by an event or circumstances which the person who caused it could not have predicted or avoided
                even if they had taken all necessary and due care. We will not make any payment if your illness, injury
                or death was your own fault. If we do make a payment, it would be similar to one you would receive under
                English Law in an English law court.</p>

            <p>We will make such payments for injury, illness or death on the following basis:</p>
            <ul class="ul">
                <li>You must tell use and the supplier involved about your injury or illness while you are in the
                    resort.
                </li>
                <li>You should also write to The Mountain Experience Company Limited about your claim within 3 months of
                    coming home from your holiday to allow us to investigate it properly and co-operate with us so as to
                    enable us to carry out such investigation. You should transfer to us any rights you have against the
                    supplier or any other person.
                </li>
                <li>You should co-operate fully with us if we or our insurers want to enforce those rights. Any payments
                    we make may be limited in accordance with international conventions. We ask you to transfer your
                    rights to us so that we can claim back from suppliers any payments we make to you, plus any legal or
                    other costs.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Should you or any member of your party suffer illness, personal injury or death, through any misadventure
                during your holiday overseas arising out of an activity which does not form part of your holiday
                arrangements we shall offer assistance in pursuing any claim you intend to make against the offending
                party. Where a payment is made you are bound to provide all reasonable help to enable us to pursue a
                claim against the third party and assign to us your rights of action.</p>
            <h4>Complaints</h4>

            <p>On arrival at your holiday destination you will be provided with an information pack containing contact
                details for the local representative of Vivid Mountain Limited who will deal with any problems or
                complaints that might arise during your holiday. If you have a complaint we will try to resolve it
                during your holiday in an amicable way. However, in the unlikely event of it not being resolved to your
                satisfaction you may of course refer the matter to arbitration under the Travel Industry Arbitration
                Service’s special scheme which provides for a simple and inexpensive method of arbitration. This scheme
                does not apply to claims for an amount greater than £2,500 per person or £10,000 per booking form or to
                claims which are solely or mainly in respect of physical injury or illness or the consequences of such
                injury or illness. Details of the scheme can be supplied upon request.</p>

            <h3>YOUR COMMITMENT TO US</h3>
            <h4>Booking</h4>

            <p>When you make your booking you must make the appropriate payment (see below). Whether you book alone or
                as a group, we will only deal with the lead booking name in all subsequent correspondence, including
                changes, amendments and cancellations. When you make an online booking you are confirming on behalf of
                all your party that you understand and have accepted these Booking Conditions and all other information
                on this website relevant to your holiday. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the personal
                details or any other information supplied in respect of yourself and any other person travelling on the
                booking and for passing on any information regarding the booking or any changes made in relation
                thereto, to all persons travelling on such booking, including but not limited to information on schedule
                changes or copies of booking confirmations.</p>
            <h4>Insurance</h4>

            <p>It is a condition of booking a holiday with us that you and all other members of your party obtain Travel
                and Winter Sports insurance. If you are unable to supply details of sufficient travel insurance when you
                pay the balance of the cost of the holiday, or a signed waiver, then we will be unable to issue your
                final travel documents. We highly recommend that you obtain travel insurance at the time of booking, as
                this will provide cover in case you need to cancel your booking prior to departure. It is vital to
                ensure that your travel insurance policy provides adequate cover for cancellation, missed departure,
                unused accommodation and all activities that you plan to undertake, including skiing off-piste. </p>
            <h4>Late arrivals, delay and denied boarding</h4>

            <p>We cannot accept responsibility if you miss your flight or transfer due to late check in, check in
                queues, delays in connecting transport or delays introduced by security procedures.</p>
            <h4>Payment</h4>

            <p>When you book with us you will be required to pay a non-refundable deposit of £200 per person per
                holiday. When the booking is accepted we will issue a Confirmation of Booking Invoice by e-mail and a
                contract will exist between us from the date that this invoice is issued. An invoice for the balance of
                the cost of your holiday will be issued 11 weeks before departure by e-mail: In the event of
                circumstances arising between your booking being accepted and the balance invoice being issued that give
                rise to a surcharge, this will be shown on the balance invoice. You must pay the balance of your holiday
                at least 8 weeks before your departure date. If you don’t, we reserve the right to cancel your booking,
                retain the deposit and apply the cancellation charges detailed below.</p>

            <p>If you make your holiday booking within 8 weeks of your departure date then you must pay the full cost at
                the booking stage and a contract will exist when we accept your payment.</p>

            <p>Credit card payments will be subject to a 2% or 3% fee depending on the card type. There is no fee for
                payment by debit card.</p>
            <h4>Your alterations</h4>

            <p>If after your holiday has been confirmed you want to change to another resort or change the departure
                date or accommodation, we will do our utmost to make this possible provided written notification is
                received at our office from the person who signed the booking form.</p>

            <p>An administration fee of £50 per person will be charged together with any additional costs of the new
                holiday. Changes within 8 weeks of departure are treated as cancellations of the original booking and
                cancellation charges will apply.</p>
            <h4>Your cancellation</h4>

            <p>If you or anyone on your holiday booking decides to cancel the holiday or part of it we must be notified
                in writing. If the cancellation results in a person travelling alone, a single room supplement is
                payable. The following scale shows the amount payable on cancellation, depending upon when we receive
                your written instructions:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>When we receive notification</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>Cancellation charges as % of total holiday cost</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>More than 56 days</td>
                    <td>Deposit forfeited</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>55 to 35 days</td>
                    <td>45%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>34 to 21 days</td>
                    <td>60%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>20 to 8 days</td>
                    <td>90%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>7 days or less</td>
                    <td>100%</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <h4>Your behaviour and responsibility</h4>

            <p>You and your party undertake to behave in a fair and responsible way towards Vivid Mountain, its clients
                and those who provide elements of your holiday. If you fail to do so we have the right to terminate your
                holiday and we will have no further obligations towards you. Any costs that result from improper action
